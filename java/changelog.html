    <li><span class="bad">BG-84</span>: Plenty of floating point errors</li>
    <li><span class="bad">BG-85</span>: Lockout challenges reset before healing gets applied, leaving you with effectively 9 turns to do it</li>

    <li><span class="bad">BG-81</span>: Disasters do not cancel bonus damage from elements if you don't attack with a weapon</li>

</ul>
<h4><b>Potions</b></h4>

    <li>Potions give you temporary buffs for some amount of buffs. However, most potions have a level requirement for them to be used</li>

        <li>Main elements are not necessarily the one that does the most average damage</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Modified some average dps's of lower-tier weapons &amp; spells (otherwise common spell 1's would end up having negative dps)</li>
    <li>Added a random multiplier for spells (they can deal between 0.5x and 1.5x the base average dps, but also take that same multiplier amount of the base mana cost)</li>

    <li>Islands: Players will start and end their turns on an island. There are a maximum of 25 islands possible (potentially more later)</li>
    <li>Bridges: This is the only way to traverse between islands! They take up a fraction of a melee attack, which makes melee attacks deal less damage</li>

<h4><b>Bridges</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>When you build a bridge, there is a 10% chance the bridge ends up being a t(r)oll</li>
    <li>Toll bridges cost ability points in the following formula: The minimum distance to travel between the start and end islands on <b>free</b> bridges, divided by 2, rounded up</li>
    <li>All bridges take 0.2 turns to cross, and take away 20% from your total melee damage (additive)</li>
    <li>You can cross a maximum of 5 bridges before you "run out of breath"</li>
    <li>Bridges are bidirectional!</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Changes</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>You can only attack a player if you are on the same island as them</li>
    <li>You can now melee attack <b>multiple</b> players on the same turn!</li>
    <li>The amount of xp required to level up has been reverted</li>
    <li>Upon entering the gulag your mana regen is now set to 1</li>
    <li>Upon entering the gulag your max health is now set to 10</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Fixes</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="bad">BG-21</span>: Game crashes when a player dies</li>
    <li><span class="bad">BG-22</span>: Weapons and spells do not reset upon death</li>
    <li><span class="bad">BG-23</span>: Health regen does not reset to 1 upon death</li>
