<h2><b><u>Version 2.7.7 Release</u></b></h2>
<p>Posted 9:42pm on Feb 9, 2024</p>
<br>
<p>A 2-in-1 update! 2 major features added</p>
<p>Note that this update is waiting for Tourney Group Game 1 to terminate to be released</p>
<h3><b>Additions</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Potions: Purchase them for temporary buffs!</li>
    <li>AOE Spells: Cast a spell onto everyone on a single island!</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Potions</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>During your turn, you May purchase and consume potions whenever you want!</li>
    <li>Potions give you temporary buffs for some amount of buffs. However, most potions have a level requirement for them to be used</li>
    <li>You can only have one potion of each type active at once. For example, you cannot drink another healing potion if you already drank one in the previous turn</li>
    <li>This is the only way to go above the 80 AP limit on some stats!</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>AOE Spells</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can launch these spells and hit every player on the island you choose!</li>
    <li>You deal the same amount of damage to every player on that island</li>
    <li>Just like other spells, AOE spells cost mana to use and can only be used once per turn</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Changes</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The "extra damage" perk from Strength has been nerfed from +1% per Strength -&gt; +0.5% per strength</li>

</ul>
<br>

        <li>Main elements are not necessarily the one that does the most average damage</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Modified some average dps's of lower-tier weapons &amp; spells (otherwise common spell 1's would end up having negative dps)</li>
    <li>Added a random multiplier for spells (they can deal between 0.5x and 1.5x the base average dps, but also take that same multiplier amount of the base mana cost)</li>
    <li>Reverted island construction cost to the original</li>
